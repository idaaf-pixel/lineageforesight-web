                <h2>Build decision-ready intelligence inside real decision contexts</h2>
                <p>We work with a small number of institutional partners to build decision-ready intelligence inside real decision contexts. Not a report delivered from outside — a structured engagement where your knowledge of what matters meets our method for making it legible.</p>
                <p>What makes this different from consultancy is what it produces. A pilot doesn't just generate insight for your organisation. It generates evidence for how decisions about creative value can be made differently — across institutions, across borders, over time. Your case becomes part of a growing infrastructure that makes the next decision, in the next organisation, better informed.</p>
                <p>This is a founding commitment. We invest methodology and analytical capacity. You invest institutional context and real decisions. Both sides shape something that didn't exist before.</p>
                <p>A limited number of pilot partnerships are available in 2026.</p>
                <p class="partner-cta-lead">If your assessment surfaced something you recognise — let's talk about what it would take to change it.</p>

                <h2>Help build the first European baseline for decision-readiness</h2>
                <p>The first European baseline for decision-readiness in the creative economy is being built right now. Every assessment response contributes to it. Research partners go further.</p>
                <p>A research partnership is a longer commitment to building the infrastructure itself — contributing sustained institutional perspective to an evidence base that compounds with every engagement. You don't receive a deliverable. You become part of how this field develops its capacity to know what it's doing.</p>
                <p>A small number of founding research partnerships are open. This is a mutual investment — not a grant, not a fee for service, but a commitment to building something the sector has never had.</p>
                <p class="partner-cta-lead">If you think the creative economy deserves better intelligence than it currently has, this is how it gets built.</p>
